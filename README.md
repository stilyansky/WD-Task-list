# Project Title

WireDelta - Assignment 1 - Task List


## Project Description

### Assignment specifications:
"Build a task list website using HTML and CSS. You are to design a website that presents a set of tasks to its users. An example of a task is ‘do the shopping’. The website should be implemented using static content for the tasks, i.e. it does not need to be data driven as that is covered in later modules."


## Built With

The website has been build with:
* HTML5
* CSS3

### HTML

The code is organised as follows:
1. Logo
2. Navigation menu
3. Header images - notepad + to do image
4. Table containing the main content of the current page
5. Footer

**NOTE** - the .js file has been added to the bottom of the page in order to speed up the loading time
(so that the HTML can load first and the functionality afterwards)

The website is designed in tree pages:
* Home
* Tasks
* About

#### Home

The task list serves as a home screen. Here the user can see all the tasks in the list.
Upon pressing of any task the user is directed to the Tasks page.

There is simple animation on the header image to spice up the rigid design.

#### Tasks

On this page the user sees a task in more detail, plus the asignee to the the task and
the tasks deadline.

#### About

A short about page with some information about the website.


### CSS

The website has been designed for a optimal resolution of 1366x768, since it is the most
popular resolution currently(https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp).

The website has also been designed to be responsive to smaller screens.

The code is structured as follows:

1. A quick reset of a the browsers default margins and paddings
2. General styles with styles of the Home page
3. Task page styles
4. Responsive styles (media queries)

### JavaScript

There is only a small error message to be displayed if the user clicks on the "Add task" and "Mark task as complete" buttons on the pages.
